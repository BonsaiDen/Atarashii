The code itself is written in Python and uses the corresponding Python bindings
for the GTK+ libraries.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
Q: Why another Twitter Client?
A: I switched to Ubuntu a couple of weeks ago so I finally got workspaces
   (which means that I now have 5 times the amount of windows open that I had on
    windows).
   
   Echofon didn't notify me about new tweets when I was on a different workspace
   than firefox was on, so I created my own twitter client!
   
Q: Hey! I know Japanese and Atarashii doesn't mean "new"!
A: Yes I know, "new" is "Shin". But to me that sounds boring so I decided to
   go with Atarashii and fool all people that can't speak Japanese.

Q: Are you the only one working on this project?
A: No I'm not, "the kittens" are also working on it! ^.^"

Q: Who are "the kittens"?
A: Just a bunch of programming kittens I think, they just joined me recently so 
   I don't know everything about them yet, but I guess they do have their 
   reasons.
	
Q: Your Python code uses tabs instead of spaces! That's against PEP08!
A: Indeed it is, but the kittens don't like using spaces, you know every single 
   kitten has their own indentation settings, there are a couple of them using 2
   space indentation, while others use 4 spaces, and I also think there's Carlo 
   who has 2 16:10 monitors and favors 8 spaces.
   
   And since the kittens are democratic, they decided to go with a compromise. 
   Tabs. Now every kitten can decide on their own how wide those tabs should be 
   displayed.

Q: What's the kittens favorite food?
A: Most recently they have switched to Sushi, which means I'm running in to 
   money problems in the short term...
   
   But they also do like cheesecake, fruit yogurt and all sorts of exotic 
   fruits.

Q: Can I get one of the kittens? PLEASE! PLEASE!
A: You can't haz me! -Carlo

Q: What's next up for the kittens?
A: Currently they're planing on inventing a device that can explode black holes!
   Why are they doing this? I've got no idea! I guess that's what coding kittens
   do in their spare time...
