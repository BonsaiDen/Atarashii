# Atarashii
Twitter on your GNOME Desktop!

Atarashii(Japanese for "New") is a simple Twitter Client for the GNOME Desktop.
It uses GTK+ and webkit to archive a slim and functional design.
The code itself is written in Python and uses the corresponding Python bindings for the GTK+ libraries.

## Installation

### Notes
