# C0111 = Missing docstring
# E1102 = not callable
# E1101 = has no member, generated more than 700 times due to the splitting of gui etc. into subclassed
# E0203 = access to member before definition, reason: same as above

# W0201 = attribute defined outside of init, again raised due to the above
# W0403 = relative import, since atarashii is not installed as a module we don't care
# W0231 = init method of base class not called, again...
# W0703 = catch exception
# W0232 = Class has no init method

# F0401 = import failed, this happens with constants.py and co, don't know why but the messages are annoying
